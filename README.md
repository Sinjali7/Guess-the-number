# Guess-The-Number-Game
Very 1st project.

 
 Apparently for a college assignment.
# How-To-Play
You'll be guided to the game and you'll have 3 levels of the game.


Level 1: 1-100


Level 2: 1-1000


Level 3: 1-10000


You'll have to guess the number between the range.

# Things-to-mind
Please press 'yes' as a whole letter to proceed to the game.

You'll have to choose between the 3 levels to proceed. If chosen other, the game will end.
